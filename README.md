# Yung Bot Rework - V3

This is a rework of [Yung Bot](https://yungcz.com/yungbot) V3.0

## Under Development
The current version of Yung Bot you are working at is under development, with the current alpha version listed on the commit.

There are updates atleast 2-3 times a week on this project and its something for me to do when I'm bored, hopefully I'll add a new command or function every single week.

## How do I run the code?
Please note, we are under development, this means the current code is unfinished and will have a lot of bugs and missing features.

However if you still wish to run the code, please run index.py and hope for the best.

If there's any issues that you encounter please post it on issues on GitHub, we'll try to fix it!
